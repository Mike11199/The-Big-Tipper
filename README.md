First android app project, following a freeCodeCamp tutorial and adding custom features. <br>


To install, download the APK (Android Application Package) file named <strong>The Big Tipper App File.apk</strong> from this repository.  

Created wtih Android Studio IDE and coded in Kotlin, a Java inspired statically typed programming language.
